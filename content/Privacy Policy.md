# 1. Legal Obligations for a UK-based Company (London HQ)

### **UK baseline**

- You’ll be under the **UK GDPR** (the UK’s version of the EU GDPR) and the **Data Protection Act 2018**.
    
- This requires you to:
    
    - Have a **Privacy Policy** that is clear and transparent.
        
    - Obtain **user consent** for processing personal data (where applicable).
        
    - Allow users to exercise rights: access, rectification, deletion (“right to be forgotten”).
        
    - Secure data appropriately (encryption, access control).
        
    - Register with the **ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office)** if you process personal data beyond “purely personal/household use.”
        

### **EU users**

- Since you’ll likely have EU users, you also fall under **EU GDPR**. Luckily, the UK GDPR and EU GDPR are nearly identical.
    
- You may need to appoint an **EU representative** if you process a “large scale” of EU users’ data. At MVP stage, this is unlikely to be enforced, but worth planning for.
    

### **Other countries**

- **US (California, etc.)**: CCPA/CPRA require clear disclosure of data collection and opt-out rights.
    
- **Canada (PIPEDA), Australia (Privacy Act), etc.**: similar obligations for transparency, user rights, and security.
    
- In practice, most startups adopt a **GDPR-compliant policy globally**, since GDPR is the strictest. This way you don’t need separate policies per region — you’re covered.
    

### **Chrome Web Store requirements**

- You must publish a **clear Privacy Policy URL** if your extension collects “personal or sensitive user data.”
    
- Even if you only collect chat text that the user chooses to save, this counts.

## 3. Data Retention

- Stored chat data is kept only as long as needed for you to use the Service.
    
- If you delete data, it will be removed from your view immediately.
    
- We may retain deleted data briefly (within third-party AI providers’ retention policies, e.g. 24h–55 days) for safety and legal purposes.
